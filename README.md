# ECE 20875 Python for Data Science
## Course Description
This course will introduce Python programming to students through data science problems. Students will learn Python concepts as well as introductory data science topics, and will use their knowledge of Python (and prior programming experience) to implement data analyses.

## Course Contents
- Bash scripting, basic Python
- Higher order functions, map/reduce, regular expressions, basic text processing
- Regular expressions, N-gram analysis, probability distributions
- Data structures: lists, arrays, associative arrays, sampling and estimation
- Iterators and generators, regression
- Objects, Clustering (k-means)
- Classifiers (kNN, naive bayes)
- Perceptrons, neural nets, PyTorch
- Project
